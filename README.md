task flow
=========

# Overview
During unity game developing, I need some script for build/distribute/etc..
 so I made this repo for reuse template tasks.

```
root/
|- config.yaml
|- tasks/
   |- utils/
   |- task_something_0
   |- task_something_1
   |- task_...
```

# contents
* rake based - ruby(what i prefer)
* invoke based - python
* csharp code util
